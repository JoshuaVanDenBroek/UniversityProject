This is the code for my university project. 

The encryption application can run on Windows and will require the user to select a word document so that it can be encrypted.

The decryption application can run on both Windows and Android using a Python emulator, the user is asked to select an image of ciphertext for that to be scanned for text
and then decrypted.

All of the code is programmed by Me and is copyrighted.
